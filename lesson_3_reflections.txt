When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    You could use a remote repository to back up your code, or to work from multiple 
    locations or multiple computers, or to collaborate with other people who
    don't have access to your local copy.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	If you are collaborating, you may not want to get someone elses
	code yet if you are in the middle of a feature.
